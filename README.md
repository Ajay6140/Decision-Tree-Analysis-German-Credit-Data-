# Decision-Tree-Analysis-German-Credit-Data-
The German Credit dataset has data on 1000 past credit applicants, described by 30 variables. Each applicant is also rated as “Good” or “Bad” credit (encoded as 1 and 0 respectively in the Response variable). The GermanCredit.xls file contains the variable descriptions and the data. New applicants for credit can be evaluated on these 30 variables. We would like to develop a credit scoring rule that can be used to help determine whether a new applicant presents a good or bad credit risk. Here, we will attempt to obtain a decision tree based model to determine if new applicants present a good or bad credit risk. The original data has been transformed to ease analysis in this initial assignment. It is informative to compare the original and transformed data descriptions to see how different variables have been transformed.
